# core

```go
import "github.com/go-coldbrew/core"
```

package core is the core module for cold brew and provides the base implementation for Cold Brew.

The idea behind cold brew is simple, we want to reuse as many good components that we can by providing only a thin wrapper around them if needed.

### The components in use by cold brew currently are

```
github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
github.com/prometheus/client_golang
github.github.com/afex/hystrix-go
github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go
github.com/newrelic/go-agent
```

The core module provides the base implementation for Cold Brew. It provides the following features

```
- A base implementation for a gRPC server
- A base implementation for a gRPC gateway
- A base implementation for health check
- A base implementation for metrics
- A base implementation for a circuit breaker
- A base implementation for a tracing
- A base implementation for a new relic
- A base implementation for a logger
- A base implementation for a gRPC server reflection
```

The core module is the base module for cold brew and provides the base implementation for Cold Brew. It works in conjunction with the other modules to provide the full functionality of Cold Brew. To get started with Cold Brew, you can use cookiecutter to generate a new project from the template. The template can be found at https://github.com/go-coldbrew/cookiecutter-coldbrew

## Constants

```go
const (
    // DefaultShutdownDurationInSeconds is the default shutdown duration in seconds.
    DefaultShutdownDurationInSeconds = 15
)
```

## Variables

ErrNoService is returned when no service is set.

```go
var ErrNoService = errors.New("no service is set")
```

## func [ConfigureInterceptors](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/initializers.go#L199>)

```go
func ConfigureInterceptors(DoNotLogGRPCReflection bool, traceHeaderName string)
```

ConfigureInterceptors configures the interceptors package with the provided DoNotLogGRPCReflection is a boolean that indicates whether to log the grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection service calls in logs traceHeaderName is the name of the header to use for tracing \(e.g. X\-Trace\-Id\) \- if empty, defaults to X\-Trace\-Id

## func [SetupEnvironment](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/initializers.go#L89>)

```go
func SetupEnvironment(env string)
```

SetupEnvironment sets the environment This is used to identify the environment in Sentry and New Relic env is the environment to set for the service \(e.g. prod, staging, dev\)

## func [SetupHystrixPrometheus](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/initializers.go#L191>)

```go
func SetupHystrixPrometheus()
```

SetupHystrixPrometheus sets up the hystrix metrics This is a workaround for hystrix\-go not supporting the prometheus registry

## func [SetupLogger](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/initializers.go#L65>)

```go
func SetupLogger(logLevel string, jsonlogs bool) error
```

SetupLogger sets up the logger It uses the coldbrew logger to log messages to stdout logLevel is the log level to set for the logger jsonlogs is a boolean to enable or disable json logs

## func [SetupNROpenTelemetry](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/initializers.go#L135>)

```go
func SetupNROpenTelemetry(serviceName, license, version string, ratio float64) error
```

setupOpenTelemetry sets up the OpenTelemetry tracing It uses the New Relic OTLP exporter to send traces to New Relic One APM and Insights serviceName is the name of the service license is the New Relic license key version is the version of the service ratio is the sampling ratio to use for traces

## func [SetupNewRelic](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/initializers.go#L40>)

```go
func SetupNewRelic(serviceName, apiKey string, tracing bool) error
```

SetupNewRelic sets up the New Relic tracing and monitoring agent for the service It uses the New Relic Go Agent to send traces to New Relic One APM and Insights serviceName is the name of the service apiKey is the New Relic license key tracing is a boolean to enable or disable tracing

## func [SetupReleaseName](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/initializers.go#L98>)

```go
func SetupReleaseName(rel string)
```

SetupReleaseName sets the release name This is used to identify the release in Sentry rel is the release name to set for the service \(e.g. v1.0.0\)

## func [SetupSentry](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/initializers.go#L80>)

```go
func SetupSentry(dsn string)
```

SetupSentry sets up the Sentry notifier It uses the Sentry HTTP Transport to send errors to Sentry server dsn is the Sentry DSN to use for sending errors

## type [CB](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/types.go#L42-L54>)

CB is the interface that wraps coldbrew methods.

```go
type CB interface {
    // SetService sets the service.
    SetService(CBService) error
    // Run runs the service.
    // Run is blocking. It returns an error if the service fails. Otherwise, it returns nil.
    Run() error
    // SetOpenAPIHandler sets the OpenAPI handler.
    SetOpenAPIHandler(http.Handler)
    // Stop stops the service.
    // Stop is blocking. It returns an error if the service fails. Otherwise, it returns nil.
    // duration is the duration to wait for the service to stop.
    Stop(time.Duration) error
}
```

## type [CBGracefulStopper](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/types.go#L28-L32>)

CBGracefulStopper is the interface that wraps the graceful stop method.

```go
type CBGracefulStopper interface {
    // FailCheck set if the service is ready to stop.
    // FailCheck is called by the core package.
    FailCheck(bool)
}
```

## type [CBService](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/types.go#L16-L25>)

CBService is the interface that wraps service methods used in ColdBrew. InitHTTP initializes the HTTP server. InitGRPC initializes the gRPC server. InitHTTP and InitGRPC are called by the core package.

```go
type CBService interface {
    // InitHTTP initializes the HTTP server
    // mux is the HTTP server mux to register the service.
    // endpoint is the gRPC endpoint to connect.
    // opts is the gRPC dial options used to connect to the endpoint.
    InitHTTP(ctx context.Context, mux *runtime.ServeMux, endpoint string, opts []grpc.DialOption) error
    // InitGRPC initializes the gRPC server
    // server is the gRPC server to register the service.
    InitGRPC(ctx context.Context, server *grpc.Server) error
}
```

## type [CBStopper](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/types.go#L35-L39>)

CBStopper is the interface that wraps the stop method.

```go
