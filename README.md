# core

```go
import "github.com/go-coldbrew/core"
```

package core is the core module for cold brew and provides the base implementation for Cold Brew.

The idea behind cold brew is simple, we want to reuse as many good components that we can by providing only a thin wrapper around them if needed.

### The components in use by cold brew currently are

```
github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
github.com/prometheus/client_golang
github.github.com/afex/hystrix-go
github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go
github.com/newrelic/go-agent
```

The core module provides the base implementation for Cold Brew. It provides the following features

```
- A base implementation for a gRPC server
- A base implementation for a gRPC gateway
- A base implementation for health check
- A base implementation for metrics
- A base implementation for a circuit breaker
- A base implementation for a tracing
- A base implementation for a new relic
- A base implementation for a logger
- A base implementation for a gRPC server reflection
```

  - [func New(c config.Config) CB](<#func-new>)
- [type CBGracefulStopper](<#type-cbgracefulstopper>)
- [type CBService](<#type-cbservice>)
- [type CBStopper](<#type-cbstopper>)


## type [CB](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/types.go#L40-L45>)

CB is the interface that wraps the basic coldbrew methods. SetService sets the service. Run runs the service. SetOpenAPIHandler sets the OpenAPI handler. Stop stops the service.

```go
type CB interface {
    SetService(CBService) error
    Run() error
    SetOpenAPIHandler(http.Handler)
    Stop(time.Duration) error
}
```

### func [New](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/core.go#L356>)

```go
func New(c config.Config) CB
```

New creates a new ColdBrew object It takes a config object and returns a CB interface The CB interface is used to start and stop the server The CB interface also provides a way to add services to the server The services are added using the AddService method The services are started and stopped in the order they are added

## type [CBGracefulStopper](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/types.go#L24-L26>)

CBGracefulStopper is the interface that wraps the graceful stop method. FailCheck checks if the service is ready to stop. FailCheck is called by the core package.

```go
type CBGracefulStopper interface {
    FailCheck(bool)
}
```

## type [CBService](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/types.go#L16-L19>)

CBService is the interface that wraps the basic service methods. InitHTTP initializes the HTTP server. InitGRPC initializes the gRPC server. InitHTTP and InitGRPC are called by the core package.

```go
type CBService interface {
    InitHTTP(ctx context.Context, mux *runtime.ServeMux, endpoint string, opts []grpc.DialOption) error
    InitGRPC(ctx context.Context, server *grpc.Server) error
}
```

## type [CBStopper](<https://github.com/go-coldbrew/core/blob/main/types.go#L31-L33>)

CBStopper is the interface that wraps the stop method. Stop stops the service. Stop is called by the core package.

```go
type CBStopper interface {
    Stop()
}
```
